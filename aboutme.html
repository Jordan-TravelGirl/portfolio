<h3> About Me </h3>
<p> Hi I am Jordan, I been born and raised in San Francisco for all my life, and I go to Gateway High School. I have always found my self being a dreamer, adifting to different places and reaching to the stars.
  From a young age, I was something different. I was mostly in my head most of time, dreaming of how to world could be.I rarely talked, in fact I didn't start talking till I was 5 years old.I lived in the Mission through my childhood had, having health care was very scare. Luckily my mom worked in Medi-cal so we were covered but my neighbors and childhood friends were afraid of going to the hospital. I remember one of them broke their arm and having to pay for the hospital was a hassal. Their mom was a single mother and had to work later to compensate for that and able to put food on the table. I
  In sense, I was very mature too, very insightful in learning different things and places. My mother is a traveler so she wanted me to get that exprience of having an open mind.  I think that by having exprience traveling in  some parts of the world,being biracial and bi-cultrual I have  become a very thoughtful person in my actions and what impact I want to make in my community. </p>
