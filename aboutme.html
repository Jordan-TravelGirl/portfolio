<h3> About Me </h3>
<p>  Hi I am Jordan, I been born and raised in San Francisco for all my life, and I go to Gateway High School. I have always found my self being a dreamer, adifting to different places and reaching to the stars.
  From a young age, I was something different. I was mostly in my head most of time, dreaming of how to world could be.I rarely talked, in fact I didn't start talking till I was 5 years old.I lived in the Mission through my childhood had, having health care was very scare. Luckily my mom worked in Medi-cal so we were covered but my neighbors and childhood friends were afraid of going to the hospital. I remember one of them broke their arm and having to pay for the hospital was a hassal. Their mom was a single mother and had to work later to compensate for that and able to put food on the table. I believe what was really a turning point for me in my life was when my mom had thyorid cancer. I don't think I hadn't really thought about it, when it was happening. She didn't have chemotherpay, she was okay after she had the surgery.Yet,I do believe that by her having cancer sparked my interest in medinice. I wanted to know how cancer worked,why did it make people sick, how did it go away, why did after surgery? So I asked my mom and she tried to explain it to a 6 year old, but I was able to understand. I strived in Science at school, as I found it so interesting and awe-insirping.To me, I believed science was the magic of this world.  In sense, I was very mature too, very insightful in learning different things and places. Lots of my friends at the time wanted to run around and play outside. I wanted to explore the world, know everything I could about the world before I headed to middle school. My mother is a traveler so she wanted me to get that exprience of having an open mind. I think that by having exprience traveling in  some parts of the world,being biracial and bi-cultrual I have  become a very thoughtful person in my actions and what impact I want to make in my community. </p>
