<h2> About Me  2</h2>
<p> Hi I am Jordan, I been born and raised in San Francisco for all my life, and I go to Gateway High School. I have always found my self being a dreamer, adifting to different places and reaching to the stars.
  From a young age, I was something different. I was mostly in my head most of time and rarely talked, in fact I didn't start talking till I was 5 years old. Now I am making up for lost time.
  Also, I was very mature too, very insightful in learning different things and places. My mother is a traveler so she wanted me to get that exprience before I was old enough to form my opinion of the world. I started
  traveling since I was 6 months old. I think that by having exprience traveling some parts of the world,being biracial and bi-cultrual I have been a very thoughtful person in my actions and what impact I want to make in my community. </p>
