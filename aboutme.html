<h3> About Me </h3>
<p> Hi I am Jordan, I been born and raised in San Francisco for all my life, and I go to Gateway High School. I have always found my self being a dreamer, adifting to different places and reaching to the stars.
  From a young age, I was something different. I was mostly in my head most of time, dreaming of how to world could be.I rarely talked, in fact I didn't start talking till I was 5 years old.I lived in the Mission through my childhood had, having health care was very scare. Luckily my mom worked in Medi-cal so we were covered but my neighbors and childhood friends were afraid of going to the hospital. I remember one of them broke their arm and having to pay for the hospital was a hassal. Their mom was a single mother and had to work later to compensate for that and able to put food on the table. I
  In sense, I was very mature too, very insightful in learning different things and places. My mother is a traveler so she wanted me to get that exprience of having an open mind.  I think that by having exprience traveling in  some parts of the world,being biracial and bi-cultrual I have  become a very thoughtful person in my actions and what impact I want to make in my community. </p>

<h4>Hobbies</h4>
<p> I travel and plan to study aboard when I get into college. Traveling has really gave me a different perpective in life, and it has brought be to be grateful for what I have. How Traveling has given me inspriation in my writing. Writing is also a passion I have because writing gives me an escape from the real world. The real world can be very overwheleming, espiecally for a girl that's about to become a senior. College, living on your own, a different city, is immediate to someone that cares about her family a lot and doesn't see a life without seeing them constantly. I believe by writing novels, books, poetry, I can bring peace to me, and others that feel the same way. That they aren't the only ones expericing these things.It's a positive outlet that I can put into my feelings. Eating different foods, has been another way I can experience different cultures without traveling. Eating Latin American food connects me to my other half my family, eating bring my family together and to us sharing stories, learning something new about each other. My family has always been there for me and I can always rely on them, so it's naturally I want the best for them. I also love cooking with my grandma, and gardening with her. I somewhat like to take care of something that needs your help to grow, to become big and strong, to give others what need to survive too. It's fun, and I like using it to cook so that we know what we are putting in our body.  </p>
